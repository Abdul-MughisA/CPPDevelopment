Copy Initialisation
int var = 1
This is simple to read.

Direct Initialisation
int var(1)

Direct List Initialisation
int var{1}
This is preferred.

Copy List Initialisation
int var = {1}

Value Initialisation
int var {}
Usually initialises to 0.

Initialise values to 0 if you are then going to use them.

Put [[maybe_unused]] before init to prevent errors for unused variables.

' for chars and " for strings.

When values are "initialised" but not assigned, they are given the value currently at that memory location.

std::cout << "This is a really, really, really, really, really, really, really, "
    "really long line\n"; // one extra indentation for continuation line

void() used for procedures.
